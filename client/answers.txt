do proper testing to find any vulnerabilities


* Describe how web servers work.
Web servers can both be the physical computer and the software program  that dispense the web page asked for by the web client. A users requested a page on the internet by typing in a url (which is a user friendly version of an IP address). The browser then requests the full URL from the web server. The server then sends the requested pages. The browser displays the pages (or an error if appropriate).
